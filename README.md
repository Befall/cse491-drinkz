Got 1 done, I think. Still confused on how the requests are defined but my testing seemed to work.
Got 2 done.
Got 3 done except for getting it working on Arctic. I got everything working locally with identical conditions and inputs. Refer to db.save_db_sqlite and db.load_db_sqlite to see it, I'm proud of that code.
No idea how to do 4.
Got 5 done minus passwords. Didn't have time.

Overall, I'm sorry I've been such a shit student and a burden to Titus especially. I wish you all the best.
